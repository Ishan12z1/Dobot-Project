# requirements.txt — Voice-Controlled Fruit Sorting

# --- Core math/vision ---
numpy>=1.23
# Use one of the two OpenCV wheels depending on environment:
opencv-python>=4.8.0; platform_machine != "aarch64"
opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0; platform_machine == "aarch64"

# --- Audio / speech ---
pyaudio>=0.2.14          # needs system PortAudio
vosk>=0.3.45
pyttsx3>=2.90

# --- GStreamer Python bindings ---
PyGObject>=3.44.0        # needs system GStreamer + GI dev packages

# --- Hailo SDK (Python modules come from the SDK; usually NOT pip-installed) ---
# hailo               # provided by HailoRT/SDK
# hailo_apps          # provided by Hailo TAPPAS/Apps
# If your SDK exposes pip packages, uncomment and pin them appropriately.

# --- Robot control (local/custom) ---
# dobot_lib           # local module or vendor package; install from your source
